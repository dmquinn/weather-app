<h1>React Weather App</h1>

<h4>Visit the deployed page <a href="https://dmquinn.github.io/weather-app/">here</a>
  
<br/><br/>
This app uses the openWeatherMap API to display weather, temperature, humidity and wind of a user's chosen city.  It also features dynamic background images from the Unsplash API (using the same query input as a search term to ensure images correlate to the chosen city).  The app shows a four day forecast of weather-type, maximum and minimum temperatures for each day as well as dynamic changing svg icons representing weather type/cloud coverage.<br/><br/>The App is fully responsive and all svg icons were made by me for this project
